## why

Concurrently, there remains a need to:

1. pragmatically develop the 'rules of the road' for Internet-native organizations; and
2. expose lawyers & students to the 'rules of the road' for Internet-native organizations (Continuing Legal Education, "CLE");
3. educate the public about the 'rules of the road' for Internet-native organizations (Public Legal Education, "PLE"); and
4. meet Internet-native organizations legal needs at the most prosocial supply & demand curve possible.&#x20;
