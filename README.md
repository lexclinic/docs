# welcome to LexClinic!

## why

Concurrently, there remains a need to:

1. lower legal costs
2. increase legal certainty
3. firmly establish legal engineering as a profession
4. manifest the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) into reality

## how&#x20;

1. **paid** on-the-job 'apprenticeship' training
   * often the only form of legal engineering or cryptolawyer education available
   * historically, law was only taught through apprenticeships&#x20;
   * apprenticeships remain an important part of legal education to this day
   * apprentices work for journeypersons operating within [houses](broken-reference)&#x20;
2. create pragmatic softlaw/hardlaw-complementary open source templates&#x20;
   * in accordance with market demand
   * 'code deference' automate with hardlaw as much as possible
3. offer Continuing Legal Education "CLE" to lawyers
4. offer Public Legal Education "PLE" to retail
5. provide services up-to-but-not-including operating as a law firm
   * e.g. intakes, issue spotting, paralegal, tutorship, AMA office hours
   * modeled after law school clinic design
   * work in concert with participating law firms

## # Clinic fee

At this early stage, the Clinic fee is 20%.&#x20;

However, the Clinic is not-for-profit.&#x20;

When the Clinic's revenue matures enough, this fee will be lowered or removed altogether.

## alpha mode

The Clinic is still alpha. This means please be patient with us as we figure out our processes and document them. It also means you're more than welcome to help us shape our decentralized future. Feedback is welcome!
