# open a file

## client or project

If there's no agent acting on behalf of the stablecoin's origin, the file is a project-file.

Otherwise, the file is a client-file.&#x20;

## house

Each file should be associated with 1 designated house only.

* visit [Discord server](../../house/discord-server.md) for details

A house dean is responsible for ensuring all files in the house receive adequate hospitality.&#x20;

## role

Each file has at least 4 [contributors](../../seal/contributor.md), including 2 apprentices.

Apprentices must perform at least 2/3 of billable work time on the file.

## treasury asset-node & token liability-node

Each client or project should have 1 asset-node and 1 liability-node.

The liability-node is at the exploratory stage and should not be relied on as an accounting method.
