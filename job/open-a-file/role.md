# role

## contributor

Each file must have at least 4 contributors:

* 1 liaison
* 1 journeyperson
* 2 apprentices

Anyone can find a potential patron or project and reach out to liaisons and journeypersons to get the file started, including apprentices.

### liaison

A house dean responsible for:

* organizing the initial contributors on the file
* if a patron-file, negotiating expectations and payment with the patron
* if a project-file, performing the client's role
* ensure contributors are invoicing and getting paid
* establish the file
  * includes initiating and administering the asset-node and liability-node
* is the Next-signor on the treasury asset-node multisig

The file's liaison cannot be the file's journeyperson.&#x20;

The liaison can be a dean from a different house than the file's hosting house.

The liaison receives compensation for the role directly from the Clinic, not the patron.

### journeyperson

The journeyperson is responsible for:&#x20;

* adding or removing contributors from the file and liability-node
* managing the contributors' workflow and deadlines
* work-product quality assurance
* if a patron-file, negotiates expectations and payment with the liaison
* the file on Discord

The standard billable rate for a journeyperson is `$200/hour + %20 clinic fee = $240/hour`.&#x20;

Tips are encouraged!

### apprentice

An apprentice must be a law student or one of the other future enumerated student types.

An apprentice is managed by the journeyperson.

The standard billable rate for an apprentice is:

* `junior: $25/hour + %20 clinic fee = $30/hour`
* `senior: $35/hour + %20 clinic fee = $42/hour`

Tips are encouraged!

A paralegal is not an apprentice but is still managed by the journeyperson.
