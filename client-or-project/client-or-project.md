# client or project

If there's no agent acting on behalf of the stablecoin's origin, then the treasury is a project-treasury.

Otherwise, the treasury is a client-treasury.&#x20;

If the treasury is a project-treasury, the Origin signor will be represented by the agent of a different House than the Next signor's House agent.
