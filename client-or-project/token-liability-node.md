# token liability-node

These tokens are held by the contributors and [http://dao.lex.clinic](http://dao.lex.clinic) .

Tokens are non-transferable and are not intended to have any monetary value.

This is an experimental use of tokens. The idea is that these tokens represent liabilities rather than assets.&#x20;

In other words, burning one of these tokens means a release from liability.

## example

[Token](https://app.kali.gg/daos/137/0xfed8909bcbb6f4a0feb9e1ede3ee0d0e83f5ec21) for the anon client file LC5578.

## proposal

This proposal system is designed with the idea that each contributor is an administrator who can unilaterally modify the liability node's state.

* voting period: 1 day&#x20;
* participation needed: 1%
* approval needed: 1%
* token transferability: disabled
* grace period: 0

We're still determining how many tokens to mint and when to mint.&#x20;

* 100,000 each seems to be fine&#x20;

## seal

An NFT-seal collection is used as an arrayed legal wrapper.

### required

* [entity](../seal/seal/entity.md)
* [contributor](../seal/seal/contributor.md)
